<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Add the following as assets to be used as collateral in yVaults. 
Strategy smart contracts to farm CREAM are already written and ready to go (pending approval).
* BAL
* COMP
* CRV
* LEND
* LINK

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
Farm dat CREAM 🐄🐄🐄

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections-->
Strategy smart contracts to farm cream with the above assets are already written and ready to go (pending approval). In addition, simply add a new Vault in the yVault panel to accept deposits and execute the strategies. These are based on the already existing yYFI strategy. 

**For:** YES! Add 5 New Vaults With Ready Code

**Against:** No change.
