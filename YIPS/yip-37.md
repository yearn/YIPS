## Summary
Use early LP rewards to enable YFI holders to participate in Curve DAO governance and vote-lock them for 4 years to boost yVault CRV generation by up to 2.5x.

All vested CRV tokens earned by StrategyYfii will be vote-locked to give YFI holders voting rights in Curve DAO and to boost the rewards earned by yCRV pool.
