## Simple Summary

Allow donors who donated to claim back donations or leave them to be used to purchase YFI.

## Abstract

While I am very appreciative of the donations, the [article](https://decrypt.co/37995/exclusive-yfi-andre-cronje-broke-quitting-defi) was a gross misrepresentation of our discussion. I am not in financial detriment, I do have debt, but I have assets in crypto to offset my fiat debt. I am simply not interested to swap my crypto to fiat, since I value my crypto more than fiat.

As such, I propose a small system, whereby donors can claim back their donations, should they wish. If however they do not claim it back by x date, then the funds (currently \$150,000) will be used to market buy YFI. I wish to use this YFI as a governance vote and we can also use it to incentivize other events or requirements.

## Motivation

Having spoken to donors, its a mix of “use it for the protocol” vs “it is an insult to return it”, so I wanted to come up with a new solution that benefits all participants.

**FOR**: Build the claim back and purchase system.

**AGAINST**: Return the donations.

## Specification

I will implement a simplistic contract that allows donors to reclaim, should they not wish to do so, after maturity date, YFI will be purchased and staked in governance.
