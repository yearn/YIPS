## Simple Summary
Divide any further YFI inflation, allocating 50% to Liquidity Pools and 50% to the Multisig.

## Abstract
* There are currently no funds being allocated to developing and improving the yearn ecosystem.
* Further inflation of YFI provides an opportunity to fulfill funding needs.

## Motivation
Using YFI from inflation to fund development is a sustainable mechanism to strengthen the yearn ecosystem and align contributors.

**FOR**: Allocate 50% of YFI inflation to Liquidity Pool incentives and 50% to the Multisig.

**AGAINST**: No changes to YFI inflation distribution.

## Specification

### Overview
* Designate 50% of future YFI emissions to LP rewards contract.
* Designate 50% of future YFI emissions to Multisig (or DAO if applicable).
* This will stay in place until stopped or adjusted.

### Rationale

Some YFI should be reserved to secure and improve the yearn ecosystem while properly incentivizing liquidity pools. Starting with a 50% // 50% split to LPs and Multisig, respectively, allows proper funding for both stakeholders, while retaining flexibility to adjust the distribution if necessary.
