## Summary

Replace the three least active multisig signers with new people. After an [open call](
https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1533222650838908928
) and careful consideration, we've selected three candidates: 0xngmi, monoloco, and lefteris.
 
## Motivation

The multisig has been effectively operating as 6 of 6-7 with two signers being inactive and another one too busy with his own project. We appreciate their service, but we got to a threshold where we need another rotation. Here are the signing rates over the last two months, since 2022-04-13 till 2022-06-13.
